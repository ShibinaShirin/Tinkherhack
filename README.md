# MEDICOCARE
Doctors and patients in our state requires a single platform for effective communication between them. A patient may have different medical records from different doctors they have visited. It is difficult to keep the records.. The app will have profiles for each patients and doctors. The whole history of the patients is uploaded to their profiles after each treatments. By checking their ID or scanning a QR code, doctors should get the full medical history of the patient-the medicines he/she has consumed in his life time, the drugs he/she is taking at the present time, his/her allergies, the surgeries has gone through etc. This will allow the doctor to have a total idea of the patient. Hospitals can also have their own profiles. The app will have add on facility like booking appointment for the doctor. The patients can have an idea about the time of the appointment by checking how many is left before them.
